#### *Python • MySQL • SQLAlchemy • Pandas • Tableau*

An end-to-end Business Intelligence and Data Analytics project where I built a relational database, extracted and transformed data using Python, computed sales KPIs, and visualized insights through an interactive Tableau dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world sales analytics workflow and covers:

* **Database creation** using MySQL
* **Synthetic data generation** for customers, products, and transactions
* **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** using Python + SQLAlchemy
* **Data cleaning & feature engineering**
* **KPI calculation** for sales insights
* **Interactive dashboard development** in Tableau

It demonstrates strong **data analysis**, **SQL**, **Python**, and **dashboarding** skills used in data analytics and BI roles.

## 🧱 Database Structure

The MySQL database consists of **three relational tables**:

| Table         | Description                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **customers** | Customer information (name, region)                     |
| **products**  | Product details (name, category, price)                 |
| **sales**     | Individual transactions, linked to customers + products |

These tables are connected via **foreign keys**.

## 🔍 Data Processing & Transformation (Python)

Using **Python, Pandas, and SQLAlchemy**, the following steps were performed:

### ✔ Data Extraction

* Connected securely to MySQL using SQLAlchemy
* Joined customers, products, and sales tables

### ✔ Data Cleaning

* Removed records with missing or zero `sale_amount`
* Converted `sale_date` to a datetime object

### ✔ Feature Engineering

* Extracted **year** and **month** for time-series analysis

### ✔ KPI Calculations

* **Total sales by product category**
* **Total & average sale amount by region**
* **Monthly sales trend**

All results are displayed in tabular format inside the notebook.
